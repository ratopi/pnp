PNP is a program for tutorial purposes in the signal processing area.  It
allows to set, move and remove poles and zeros of an one dimensional digital 
filter.  The program shows different effects of the filter in the frequency 
domain.

PS: This application is from around 2000.  I nearly forgotten this little
program (laying around at SourceForge).  It was not under any version control
over the years.  I now decided to check it in in Git and publish it.  Perhaps 
someone out there will find it useful.

Have fun and don't blame me for the code ... it's old. ;-)
