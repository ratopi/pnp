PNP is an application for tutorial purposes.
You can edit a digital (one dimensional) filter.  This is done by setting and removing of its poles and zeros on the z-plane.
The program lets you display the magnitude response in linear and logarithm scale, the phase, the groupdelay and the impulse response of the filter.
